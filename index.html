                    <em>Oh, hello and welcome!</em><br>
                    Ya lookin' for somethin' specific? Ah, just takin' a look around...<br><br>
                    Lemme help ya takin' a look at this cute little page of mine.<br>
                    My name is Meatball, some call me Sputnik, which I don't like because it sounds stupid.
                    Do I look like a "Sputnik" to you? Didn't think so.
                    Most of the times my humans just call me <b>Kleine</b>
                    because I'm a really small fella, ya know.<br><br>
                    Ya seriously asking me if I am a <em>mouse</em>? Hell no!<br>
                    I am <em>much</em> cuter, and don't have that weird long thingie that's hangin' from ma buttocks. 
                    I just have a small little stump there... And no, nobody cut it off!<br><br>
                    Where was I..? Ah yes, I am actually a hamster - a golden hamster,
                    also called Syrian hamster because I have my roots there.<br>
                    There are several types of hamsters out there, but I am the biggest one! 
                    Ok, except for the ones livin' out in nature, they are bigger... but not as cute as I am!

                </p>

                    Anyways, there are many things people dunno 'bout hamsters and how to take care of 'em.<br><br>
                    For example, I am <u>not</u> a suitable pet for kids. I need ma sleep during the day, and kids tend to be quite noisy.. 
                    <br>I am active when kids are sleeping,
                    so they don't see one bit of me. And because of that they try to wake me up during the day which in turn stresses me out. 
                    By the end of the day, I will probably - no surely - die sooner. And I don't even live that long... my life expectancy is only around 2 human years..
                    So, please make sure to give ma fellow hamsters a wonderful life.<br><br>
                    To help every hamster have a happy and healthy life, ma human made this page to inform you 
                    about how to take care of a lil fella like me.<br><br>
                    <!-- Ya can also find a few stories about me like 
                    how ma humans tried to tame me... 
                    or how I climbed into a bucket full of dirty water...yikes! Went swimming for a bit, wasn't a great idea though 'cuz I can't swim...<br><br> -->
